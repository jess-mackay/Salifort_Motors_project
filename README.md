# Salifort Motors - Employee Retention Project
## Executive Summary
### Issue/Problem
Salifort Motors seeks to improve employee retention. They want to know what's likely to make an employee leave the company.
### Response
Since employee retention is a categorical variable, a random forest model was chosen.
### Impact
The model successfully predicts whether an employee will leave. The factors with the most influence on employee retention were: employee satisfaction, number of projects, and monthly hours.
### Insights/Next Steps
* Conduct regular satisfaction surveys
* Cap the number of projects that an employee can work on to 4 or 5
* Ensure employees do not work more than 250 hours per month
* Ensure employees are compensated for any overtime 
* Investigate ways to increase satisfaction for employees who have been employed for 4 years - consider further training, promotions, expanded opportunities
